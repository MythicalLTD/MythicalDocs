## What is MythicalLauncher?

Hi everyone, today we are going to talk about the [MythicalLauncher](https://github.com/MythicalLTD/MythicalLauncher) an alternative to [TLauncher](https://tlauncher.org/) witch is a spyware as we know [SEE MORE ABOUT THAT HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBTH9n6lz9o). So as I said [TLauncher](https://tlauncher.org/) is not safe anymore, so I'm working at the best free minecraft launcher which will have some awesome things in it.

## What are the requirements?

Yes and no, it depends on your operating system if it will run our launcher or not, we only support `Windows`. To see what version of windows we support, you can check up this table, Of course the minecraft requirements apply too, so you can actually run the game xD!

## FAQ

#### What if i add the API to my application?
If you add the API to your application and if it will work and have its own settings page, you will get credits for it on our GitHub repo and have an awesome role on discord!
#### Where can I request for my name to be on GitHub and get the role?
You can add me on discord: `NaysKutzu#5375` and talk there!
#### Why does the launcher show a warning when i open it?
This is because of the application signing we don't have our launcher signed yet so that's why you may get a blue/red error when you run the launcher!
#### Is this a virus?
No this is not a virus, you can see it yourself by inspecting the code on GitHub or using a decompiler like ILSpy.
#### Is there another launcher that its not a virus?
Yes there are some other launchers for cracked players like:
[TL legacy](https://tlaun.ch/?lang=en)
#### When will the project be ready?¬†
We are sorry but we don't know yet since we are working hard on making 1 of the best launchers out there!
