As IgnitionLauncher works now with an API and with no MySQL database there is no chance of data breach. If you need the API you can use our Minecraft Portal Page [IgnitionPortal](https://github.com/Ignition-Development/IgnitionPortal) or you can download it right [here](https://ignition-development.xyz/download/ighapi.zip) 

**It is highly recommended you don't start making an app from this API since it's not 100% done.**
