Hello everyone this is kinda an important announcement

We started a development team called MythicalSystems (Mythical Limited)
The host will stay the same and keep up, but we are also going to make some
awesome projects on github like Mc Launcher Mc Portal and our dashboard.

We are also registered as an own company in (AT)Austria as a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter) company, which means (LTD).

Not only that, but we are happy to have you around and thanks for using Mythical.
